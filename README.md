# Jordan J. Solomon's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of projects and reports I've worked on. 

## About Me

I transitioned from a background in C# development to the exciting world of Web3. In early 2024, I completed the Updraft Foundry Full Course by Patrick Collins, diving deep into smart contracts and decentralized applications. Inspired by this journey, I pursued further education in auditing security, mastering the art of uncovering vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of smart contracts.

My passion for problem-solving was cultivated during my 4.5 years of experience as a military officer. Leading teams through complex challenges instilled in me resilience and a keen eye for detail.

Today, armed with a diverse skill set and a thirst for innovation, I am ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow and contribute to the decentralized future.
