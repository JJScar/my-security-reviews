# Security Research Portfolio

Welcome to my Security Research Portfolio on GitHub. 
Here, you will find detailed audit reports, analyses, and discussions related to various smart contracts and blockchain technologies. My work focuses on improving the security and robustness of decentralized applications.

## About Me

My name is Jordan J. Solomon, from the UK, but aslo half Israeli. 
I am a dedicated security researcher with a background in software development and a special focus on blockchain technology. 
After transitioning from the military as an officer in the IDF, I completed intensive training in the web3 domain, including the Updraft Foundry full course by Patrick Collins and his security auditing course.
My military experience as an officer has honed my problem-solving skills, which I now apply to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains a series of directories, each dedicated to a specific audit project:

- **Audit Reports:** Each folder contains a comprehensive audit report with findings classified as high, medium, or low risk. Each report provides a detailed analysis, proof of concepts, and recommended mitigations.
- **Proof of Concepts:** Code snippets and tests demonstrating security flaws and how they can be exploited.
- **Tools and Scripts:** Tools and scripts developed to automate parts of the auditing process.

## Featured Reports

- **[Cyfrin Updraft Course Audits](https://github.com/JJScar/my-security-reviews/tree/master/cyfrin-course-audits)**
  - This folder includes all of the reports I wrote as part of the Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Secuirty Course.
- **[First Flights](link-to-report)**
  - This folder includes the reports I wrote as part of CodeHawks First Flights audits.
- **[Personal Favourites]**
