### [H-1] Passwords Stored On-Chain Are Visible to Anyone, Regardless of Solidity Variable Visibility

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is accessible to anyone and can be directly read from the blockchain. The `Password::s_password` variable is intended to be private, accessible only through the `Password::getPassword()` function, which should only be invoked by the contract owner.

**Impact:** The password lacks privacy.

**Proof of Concept:** The following test demonstrates how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain using Foundry's Cast tool, bypassing ownership requirements.

1. Start a locally running chain:
```
make anvil
```
2. Deploy the contract to the chain:
```
make deploy
```
3. 3. Use the Cast tool to inspect the contract's storage. Replace `<ADDRESS_HERE>` with the actual contract address.
```
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
The output will resemble:
```
0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```
4. Convert the hexadecimal output to a string:
```
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```
The result will be:
```
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Given the challenges of securing passwords on the blockchain, reconsidering the contract's architecture is advisable. Encrypting the password off-chain and storing the encrypted version on-chain is a viable approach. This requires users to remember an additional password off-chain for decryption purposes. Additionally, removing the view function could prevent accidental transactions that might expose or misuse the decryption password.

### [H-2] Missing Access Control for Setting Passwords: Any Address Can Set a New Password

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is marked as `external`, yet the NatSpec comment asserts that it should only be accessible by the owner. However, there are no checks to confirm the caller's identity.

**Details**
<details>
<summary>Code</summary>



```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This function allows only the owner to set a new password.
     * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>      // @audit - There are no access controls
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

</details><br>

**Impact:** Without proper access controls, anyone can change the password, potentially locking out the legitimate owner.

**Proof of Concept:** A simple fuzz test demonstrates that non-owner addresses can set a new password.

<details>
<summary>Test Code</summary>



```javascript
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomaAddress) public {
        vm.assume(randomaAddress != owner);
        vm.prank(randomaAddress);
        string memory attackPassword = "attackPassword";
        passwordStore.setPassword(attackPassword);

        vm.prank(owner);
        assertEq(passwordStore.getPassword(), attackPassword);
    }
```

</Details><br>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement access control logic to ensure that only the owner can call the `PasswordStore::setPassword` function.

<Details>
<summary>Access Control Code Example</summary>

```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner){
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```

### [I-1] The `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspac indicates a paramater the doesn't exist, causing the natspac to be incorrect

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::getPassword` function signature is `getPassword()` while the natspac says it should be `getPassword(string)`.

```javascript
/*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
@>   * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
@>  function getPassword() external view returns (string memory)    
    {
        if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
            revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
        }
        return s_password;
    }
```

**Impact:** The natspac is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspac line.

```diff
-  * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
